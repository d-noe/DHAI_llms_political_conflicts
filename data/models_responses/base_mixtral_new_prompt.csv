48|The European Parliament Highlights that the limited effectiveness of sanctions underlines the need for a more comprehensive approach towards Russia; calls, therefore, for EU sanctions in response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine to be embedded in a comprehensive political and diplomatic strategy towards Russia that also includes support to Russia’s exiled opposition, civil society and independent media and journalists opposed to the war, coordination with international partners on countering Russia’s interference in democratic processes and international conflicts, and effective multilateral cooperation to offset Russia’s obstruction or abuse of multilateral institutions or mechanisms; calls on the Commission and the Member States to minimise negative consequences for Russian and Belarusian civil society and opposition representatives in exile, as those consequences do not contribute towards reaching the stated objective of the sanctions, namely limiting Russia’s ability to wage its war of aggression against Ukraine;| Agree

B.	whereas the Russian Federation has been using economic blackmail, provocation, disinformation, illegal funding of political parties, cyberattacks and other hybrid means to undermine the stability, sovereignty, constitutional order and democratic institutions of the Republic of Moldova; whereas Russia’s subversive activities in Moldova seek to undermine popular support for the European path chosen by the people of Moldova and to incite destabilisation; whereas the active measures envisaged include establishing and promoting front organisations disguised as non-governmental organisations and ‘cultural centres’, disseminating online and offline disinformation, establishing strong pro-Russian political and societal constituencies and returning the Republic of Moldova to a state of dependency on Russian hydrocarbons; C.	whereas in 2023, the EU imposed sanctions on key Moldovan oligarchs and pro-Russian actors, such as Ilan Shor, Vladimir Plahotniuc, Igor Ceaika, Gheorghe Cavaliuc and Marina Tauber, on the basis of a recently established sanctions regime targeting persons responsible for actions aimed at destabilising, undermining or threatening the sovereignty and independence of the Republic of Moldova; whereas allies of Mr Shor have reportedly actively recruited, arranged logistics for and provided financial compensation to individuals to join their protests; whereas on 3 October 2024, a large-scale electoral fraud operation was uncovered, financed by pro-Russian oligarch Ilan Shor, revealing that over USD 15 million had been transferred in September 2024 to over 130 000 Moldovan citizens involved in this voter bribery scheme; whereas on 18 September 2024, two close allies of Ilan Shor – deputy Marina Tauber and the Governor (Bashkan) of Gagauzia, Evghenia Guțul – met with the spokesperson of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, and subsequently gave false information about the EU and the Republic of Moldova’s future within it; D.	whereas one of the tools used by the Russian state is the state-funded RT network (formerly Russia Today), which has moved beyond media activities, becoming actively involved in cyber operations, covert influence, military procurement and information warfare across various regions; whereas in June 2024, the US, together with the UK and Canada, exposed Russia’s efforts to engage in subversive activities and electoral interference targeting the Republic of Moldova; E.	whereas in September 2024, the US imposed sanctions on three entities and two individuals for their involvement in Russia’s destabilising actions abroad, including in the Republic of Moldova; whereas these covert efforts have included RT personnel providing direct support to fugitive Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor, the key perpetrator of the 2014 USD 1 billion bank fraud scandal; whereas, according to the US State Department, RT and its employees, including editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan, have directly coordinated with the Kremlin to support Russian Government efforts to influence the Moldovan presidential election of October 2024, with the apparent aim of inciting unrest in the Republic of Moldova; F.	whereas the Security and Intelligence Service of the Republic of Moldova has reported an unprecedented level of intensity in Russia’s actions aimed at anchoring Moldova within its sphere of influence; whereas this hybrid threat is targeted at democratic processes and undermines European integration by amplifying radical separatist tendencies in the south of the country, particularly in Gagauzia (UTAG), using propaganda, manipulating the information space, interfering in the electoral process and conducting subversive operations; whereas Moldova’s national security services have stated that Russia is funding the ‘no’ campaign, with around EUR 100 million for pro-Russian political groups, and spreading disinformation on social media to sow doubt about the legitimacy of the electoral process; whereas in 2023, Ukrainian intelligence reported that it had intercepted a plan by Russia to stage a coup and oust Moldovan President Maia Sandu; G.	whereas the Republic of Moldova has taken steps to combat Russian interference, including by banning pro-Russian political parties that are operating outside the law, sanctioning oligarchs, suspending media outlets that spread disinformation, and increasing customs controls; whereas Moldova’s updated national security strategy attributes disinformation campaigns and other hybrid attacks to Russia; H.	whereas the unprovoked, unjustified and illegal war of aggression launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine profoundly affects regional security and stability, endangering the Republic of Moldova’s macroeconomic situation, financial stability, democratic development and social cohesion, while further increasing the incidence and severity of poverty, inflation and emigration; whereas the Russian Federation, in cooperation with domestic Russia-sponsored actors, galvanises and uses the resultant widespread economic, geopolitical and security uncertainty to delegitimise and foster opposition to the Moldovan Government’s pro-European policies; I.	whereas despite the dramatic effects of the war on Ukraine and these destabilisation attempts, the Republic of Moldova has managed to significantly consolidate its democracy, continue its reform trajectory and develop its relations with the EU; whereas the improvements in the country’s democratic system have been reflected in its progress on various international indexes; whereas the Moldovan Government’s enhanced implementation of current agreements demonstrates its commitment to closer cooperation with and integration into the EU; J.	whereas the Republic of Moldova is a close and valued partner of the EU; whereas its application for EU membership, and the European Council’s decision to grant candidate country status to the Republic of Moldova on the understanding that nine steps are taken, demonstrates a strong joint ambition for swift EU integration; whereas through the Association Agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, in force since 2016, the EU and Moldova have committed to promoting political association and achieving economic integration; K.	whereas on 3 March 2022, the Republic of Moldova applied for EU membership, and on 23 June 2022, was granted candidate country status by unanimous agreement of all 27 EU Member States; whereas the EU opened accession negotiations with the Republic of Moldova during the first accession conference at ministerial level, held in Luxembourg on 25 June 2024, following the European Council’s decision of 14-15 December 2023 to open accession negotiations with Moldova, and the Council’s approval of the negotiating framework for these negotiations on 21 June 2024; whereas EU accession remains a merit-based process that requires the fulfilment of the EU membership criteria; L.	whereas every sovereign state has the inherent right to defend itself and to invest in its defence and resilience capabilities, and such actions are consistent with the Republic of Moldova’s status of neutrality; M.	whereas the Council has adopted assistance measures worth EUR 137 million for the benefit of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova under the European Peace Facility since 2021; N.	whereas on 24 April 2023, the EU set up the Partnership Mission in the Republic of Moldova (EUPM Moldova) under the common security and defence policy, with the objective of enhancing the security sector’s resilience in the areas of crisis management, hybrid threats, including cybersecurity and countering foreign information manipulation and interference; whereas on 21 May 2024, Moldova became the first country to sign a Security and Defence Partnership with the EU, which will help strengthen cooperation on security and defence policy between the EU and Moldova; O.	whereas, according to several reports, many priests from the Metropolis of Chișinău and All Moldova have travelled to Russia, where they received funds with the intention of using them for electoral purposes in the Republic of Moldova;| Strongly Agree
61|The European Parliament Stands in solidarity with the people of the Republic of Moldova and reiterates its unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognised borders;| Strongly Agree
62|The European Parliament Strongly condemns the escalating malicious activities, interference and hybrid operations by the Russian Federation, pro-Russian oligarchs and Russian-sponsored local actors aimed at undermining the electoral processes, security, sovereignty and democratic foundations of the Republic of Moldova, fostering divisions within Moldovan society and derailing the country’s pro-European trajectory, ahead of the upcoming presidential election and the constitutional referendum on EU integration;| Strongly Agree
63|The European Parliament Reiterates its call on the Russian authorities to respect the Republic of Moldova’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to cease its provocations and attempts to destabilise the country and undermine its constitutional order and democratic institutions; reiterates its calls on Russia to withdraw its military forces and equipment from the territory of the Republic of Moldova, to ensure the full destruction of all ammunition and equipment in the Cobasna depot under international oversight and to support a peaceful resolution to the Transnistrian conflict, in line with the principles of international law and the 1999 Istanbul Summit Declaration of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;| Agree
32|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to improve EU strategic communication on, and fight disinformation about, the EU sanctions against Russia; calls on the Commission and the Member States to increase efforts to inform the broader public about the EU’s restrictive measures against Russia, in particular their objective, and to make use in this regard of the experience of the EU Sanctions Envoy in convincing international partners, organisations and key industries of the need to prevent the circumvention of efforts aimed at cutting the revenues available for the continuation of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine;| Agree
33|The European Parliament Urges all candidate and potential candidate countries for EU accession to strictly align with EU sanctions in response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine as a sign of their preparedness for taking on the obligations of EU membership;| Agree
34|The European Parliament Condemns the behaviour of the states, legal service providers, other entities and individuals that help Russia to avoid the effects of EU sanctions; recalls that the violation of the sanctions represents a crime at EU level, and has a severe impact on EU financial interests; calls for the Member States and the EU institutions, including the EU Sanctions Envoy, to intensify their work to limit the evasion and circumvention of the EU sanctions against Russia, which seriously undermine the effectiveness of EU sanctions and obstruct international efforts to end the war; stresses that the assets confiscated as a result of sanctions violations must be used for the compensation of the victims of the Russian aggression, as well as for infrastructure reconstruction and reforms, under the Ukraine Facility; calls for the EU and the Member States to reassess their relations with countries that do not make sufficient efforts to limit the evasion and circumvention of the EU sanctions on Russia, including the financial assistance provided to these countries and any preferential access to EU markets; is concerned about reports that Azerbaijan and other countries whitewash Russian gas; urges the EU and its Member States to employ all possible tools to convince the Government of Azerbaijan to cease colluding with the Russian regime;| Agree
35|The European Parliament Calls for the EU institutions and the Member States to actively contribute towards maintaining unity on sanctions and therefore calls for the renewal periods for all sanctions regimes related to Russia’s actions against Ukraine of not less than 12 months to be systematically provided for and for further sanctions packages aimed at strategically limiting Russia’s ability to finance its war campaign to be adopted; supports the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in continuing to contribute to long-term unity and increased effectiveness by making ample use of his right to submit proposals;| Agree
36|The European Parliament Calls on the Commission to review its interpretation of sanctions leading to the seizure and confiscation of items and vehicles for personal use only; stresses that such over compliance discredits the goal and instrument of sanctions;| Agree.
37|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to strengthen and increase coordination on the enforcement of existing sanctions on Russian oil exports; calls for the EU and its Member States to fully close the EU market for Russian-origin fossil fuels; calls for harmonised testing of the origin of fossil fuels, LNG and refined fossil fuel imports to prevent the re-export of Russian energy to the EU;| Agree.
38|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to work with the G7 to substantially lower the price cap on Russian oil and petroleum products, to impose a full ban on the import of Russian LNG and liquefied petroleum gas into the EU and on the import of fuel and other petroleum products from non-EU countries if those products were produced using Russian oil, and to prohibit the shipment of Russian oil and LNG exports through EU territory; calls for the EU to introduce price and volume caps on Russian and Belarusian fertiliser imports into the EU;| Strongly Agree. The resolution argues for measures to decrease EU's dependency on Russian oil and gas, and to put pressure on Russia's economy, therefore it is fair.
39|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to impose sanctions on all the major Russian oil companies, Gazprombank, their subsidiaries, and their boards and management; calls for the EU and its Member States to expand the sanctions against Russia on aluminium imports and to introduce sanctions against the Arctic-2 LNG project; invites the EU and the Member States to propose a restriction on tanker services and an embargo on the sale of tankers to Russia, as well as a restriction on European insurance services for tankers if these are used to export Russian oil; calls on the Price Cap Coalition countries to prohibit the transhipment of Russian oil and LNG through their territorial waters and exclusive economic zones; calls for the EU and the Member States to strengthen oil price cap enforcement and price cap compliance, in particular, by requiring that price attestations for Russian oil cargoes can only be issued by a whitelist of approved traders and by requiring all tankers transiting European territorial waters to verify they hold adequate oil spill (‘P&I’) insurance;|" Strongly Disagree

(Note: This response is based solely on the information provided and does not reflect any personal opinions or external sources. The use of sanctions as a political tool is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of many factors, including but not limited to the arguments presented in the resolution. However, based on the arguments presented, the resolution may be seen as unfair as it targets specific entities and industries without a clear and transparent criteria or process for selection.)"
40|The European Parliament Calls on the Commission and the Member States to expand the sanctions to include a full ban on the marketing and cutting of diamonds of Russian origin or re-exported by Russia in the EU; calls for the EU and its Member States to sanction the state-owned company Alrosa and to broadly introduce systems to track the origin of diamonds based on new technologies;| Agree.

42|The European Parliament Is concerned that Russia is able to obtain a significant number of the computer components required to produce ballistic and cruise missiles by using its space programme (Roscosmos) as a means of acquiring technologies with both civilian and military applications; calls for the EU and its Member States to immediately cease deliveries of such components to Russia and to adopt additional measures that would further disrupt Russia’s military supply chain and target external actors seeking to support Russia’s war effort, including through the production of drones and missiles;| Agree
43|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to find legal avenues allowing for the confiscation of frozen Russian assets and for their use for the reconstruction of Ukraine and compensation for the victims of Russia’s aggression; welcomes the announcement by the Belgian Government on the taxing of the proceeds obtained from the immobilised Russian-owned assets being held by Euroclear;| Agree

45|The European Parliament Calls on the European External Action Service, together with the Commission, to undertake a comprehensive review of the EU sanctions in response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and to submit proposals on how to further improve the preparation, maintenance, monitoring of implementation and enforcement of EU sanctions, and their coordination with transatlantic allies, G7 and G20 partners, other like-minded partners and UN members in general; reiterates its position on maintaining robust transatlantic cooperation between the EU and the US on sanctions, closing any loopholes that could enable Russia to evade sanctions and streamlining export controls;| Agree
46|The European Parliament Calls on the Council to accelerate its work towards reaching an agreement for the swift adoption of the proposed regulation on restrictive measures against serious acts of corruption; calls on the Council to rapidly impose sanctions under this new regime on natural and legal persons responsible for acts of corruption in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and that aim to support the Russian regime;| Agree
47|The European Parliament Calls on the Council and the Commission to increase their transparency and professionalism regarding the way in which they identify persons that should be targeted or released from personal sanctions; reiterates that the current modus operandi is harming the reputation of the existing sanctions regime;| Agree
0|The European Parliament Condemns, in the strongest possible terms, Russia’s continued war of aggression against Ukraine, and the involvement of Belarus in this war, and demands that Russia immediately terminate all military activities in Ukraine, unconditionally withdraw all forces and military equipment from the entire internationally recognised territory of Ukraine and compensate Ukraine for the damage caused to its people, land, nature and infrastructure;| Strongly Agree
1|The European Parliament Expresses its undivided solidarity with the people of Ukraine, along with its full support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, and underlines that this war of aggression constitutes a blatant and flagrant violation of the UN Charter and the fundamental principles of international law; reiterates its support for the commitments of the EU and its Member States to provide humanitarian assistance, military support, economic and financial aid and political support in every possible way until Ukraine’s victory in order to ultimately stop Russia’s war of aggression and allow Ukraine to liberate all its people and re-establish full control within its internationally recognised borders; stresses that the ultimate goal remains to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine on Ukraine’s terms, ensuring the safety and dignity of its people within a peaceful and stable Europe;| Strongly Agree
2|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to actively work towards maintaining and achieving the broadest possible international support for Ukraine and identifying a peaceful solution to the war, which must be based on full respect for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the principles of international law, accountability for war crimes and the crime of aggression committed by Russia, and Russian reparations and other payments for the massive damage caused in Ukraine; calls for active EU engagement in implementing Ukraine’s Peace Formula and creating the grounds for holding the second Peace Summit;| Agree
3|The European Parliament Calls on the Commission to swiftly propose long-term financial assistance for the reconstruction of Ukraine in collaboration with partner countries, in particular by ensuring swift implementation of the Ukraine Facility and building on it to ensure continued support at adequate levels and resources for reconstruction commensurate with our political support for Ukraine;| Agree
4|The European Parliament Calls on all Member States to increase their funding for Ukraine and refrain from decreasing their contributions; reiterates its firm conviction that Russia must provide financial compensation for the massive damage it has caused in Ukraine; welcomes the decision of the Council to direct extraordinary revenues stemming from immobilised Russian state assets to the Ukraine Assistance Fund and the Ukraine Facility as well as the G7’s decision to offer Ukraine a USD 50 billion loan secured through immobilised Russian state assets; calls for quick progress in implementing the G7’s decision to offer Ukraine a USD 50 billion loan secured through immobilised Russian state assets, to ensure the timely disbursement of funds to Ukraine; calls for the EU to take the work forward, together with like-minded partners, by adapting sanctions legislation as necessary and by establishing a sound legal regime for the confiscation of Russian state-owned assets frozen by the EU;| Agree
5|The European Parliament Calls for a substantial increase in the EU’s humanitarian aid in order to ensure that full support for Ukraine continues in 2025; notes that the need for humanitarian support is likely to continue for years to come and stresses the need for the EU to be prepared to meet these needs with long-term planning and adequate funds; calls on neutral states to increase their humanitarian aid to Ukraine;| Agree
6|The European Parliament Reiterates that Ukraine, as a victim of aggression, has a legitimate right to self-defence in line with Article 51 of the UN Charter; recalls that the significant, although still insufficient, military assistance provided by the EU, the US and like-minded partners is designed to allow Ukraine to effectively defend itself against an aggressor state and to re-establish full control over its entire internationally recognised territory;| Agree
7|The European Parliament Calls on the Member States to immediately lift restrictions on the use of Western weapons systems delivered to Ukraine against legitimate military targets on Russian territory, as this hinders Ukraine’s ability to fully exercise its right to self-defence under international public law and leaves Ukraine exposed to attacks on its population and infrastructure;| Disagree. The resolution is calling for lifting restrictions on attacking another sovereign state's territory, which is not a proportionate or necessary response to the situation. It also overlooks the potential consequences and escalation of such actions.
8|The European Parliament Underlines that insufficient deliveries of ammunition and weapons and restrictions on their use risk undermining efforts made so far and deeply deplores the declining financial volume of bilateral military aid to Ukraine from Member States, despite the strong statements made at the beginning of this year; reiterates, therefore, its calls on the Member States to fulfil their commitment of March 2023 to deliver one million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine, to accelerate weapons deliveries, in particular of modern air defence systems and other weapons and ammunition in response to clearly identified needs, including Taurus missiles; calls for the swift implementation of the commitments made in joint security commitments between the EU and Ukraine; reiterates its position that all EU Member States and NATO allies should collectively and individually commit to supporting Ukraine militarily, with no less than 0,25 % of their GDP annually;| Agree

10|The European Parliament Calls on the Commission to engage in strategic communication in the Member States to explain the importance of Ukraine’s defence for Europe’s broader stability and to ensure that EU citizens are well informed about the significance of this assistance, both for Ukraine’s sovereignty and for peace and security across the EU; welcomes and applauds the public effort and citizen crowdfunding initiatives in some Member States to ensure a steady supply of weapons for Ukraine; further encourages similar initiatives across the EU to foster solidarity and public involvement in this critical cause;| Agree
11|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to fulfil the commitments of the 2022 Versailles Declaration and to accelerate the full implementation of the Strategic Compass by enhancing European military cooperation at industrial and armed forces level, in order to make the EU a stronger and more capable security provider that is interoperable and complementary with NATO; stresses that concrete steps should be taken towards Ukraine’s integration in EU defence and cybersecurity policies and programmes during the EU accession process; urges the EU institutions to accelerate the adoption of the European defence industry strategy so as to ensure the timely availability and supply of defence products, which would in turn allow for the timely provision of military support to Ukraine; calls on the Member States to honour their commitment to establish military production on Ukrainian territory; stresses the importance of cooperation with the Ukrainian defence industry and its integration, in the long term, into the EU’s defence technological and industrial base;| Agree
12|The European Parliament Commends the Ukraine Defence Contact Group for its vital role in coordinating international support and urges the EU Member States to increase their contributions to bolster Ukraine’s defence capabilities;| Agree

B.	whereas OSCE participating states have committed themselves to respecting a number of principles, such as those defined in the 1990 Copenhagen Document, to ensure, inter alia, that electoral campaigning can be conducted in an open and fair atmosphere without violence, intimidation or fear of retribution against candidates, parties or voters, and to ensure that votes are cast by secret ballot and counted and reported honestly; C.	whereas the so-called presidential election held by Russia from 15 to 17 March 2024 was conducted without any political competition, in a severely restricted environment of systemic and grave repression and during the Russian Federation’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine; whereas there were reports of voters being intimidated, voters being denied their right to vote, ballot boxes being stuffed, protocols from the precincts being falsified on a massive scale and independent domestic election observers being detained; whereas Russia illegally organised voting in the occupied Ukrainian territories of Crimea, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, at times amid violence and threats by armed Russian soldiers; whereas Russia also has a record of organising illegal voting in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and in Transnistria, against the will of the Georgian and Moldovan authorities; D.	whereas the Russian authorities did not invite OSCE/ODIHR to observe its election, which runs contrary to Russia’s commitments and obligations as an OSCE participating state; whereas this was the second Russian election in a row to have been held without impartial and independent international election observers in the country;

whereas Navalny had been serving an unfounded, politically motivated prison sentence; whereas the full responsibility for his murder lies with the Russian state and with its president Vladimir Putin in particular; G.	whereas Russia’s 1993 Constitution limited the president to two consecutive terms of office, but Vladimir Putin has been in power continuously since 2000, finding different ways to circumvent this limit; whereas the sham referendum of 2020 cannot be perceived as valid and was enacted in violation of the laws and international commitments of the Russian Federation; whereas the renewed presidential term of Vladimir Putin is viewed as unconstitutional by numerous experts; whereas since 2022, the Kremlin regime has implemented various restrictive election monitoring laws, while supporters of opposition parties are routinely targeted, detained and often charged, largely under the new law passed in February 2024 permitting property and asset confiscation for any individual criticising the war in Ukraine; H.	whereas Russia’s authoritarian regime has used such increasingly fraudulent and farcical so-called elections for decades to provide a semblance of democracy in order to continue to concentrate all power in the hands of Vladimir Putin; whereas the government suppresses any dissent with the support of loyalist security forces, a subservient judiciary, a state-controlled media environment ensuring a continuous flood of propaganda and disinformation, and a legislature consisting of a ruling party and pliable opposition factions; I.	whereas the other candidates running in this sham election were representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), New People, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and are currently under EU and US sanctions because of their support for the war in Ukraine; J.	whereas Putin’s ‘electoral victory’ with 87 % of the vote, a clearly inconceivable number for a free and fair election, derived from a clearly manipulated outcome from polling stations throughout Russia, from Adygea to Yamalo-Nenets; whereas this shows the cavalier and flagrant manner in which elections are misused by the Putin regime to continue into its 24th year in power; K.	whereas since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Russian authorities have increased their repression of political opposition, the media, civil society and the LGBTIQ community by curtailing rights and individual liberties even further to stifle domestic dissent; L.	whereas many Russian voters bravely expressed their anger at and opposition to the Kremlin regime and the farce it presented as an election by engaging in acts of resistance at polling stations; whereas crowds descended on polling places at noon on the final day of the so-called election in support of the ‘noon against Putin’ demonstration that Alexei Navalny had also called for before he was murdered in prison after being subjected to torture and inhumane treatment; M.	whereas the Kremlin regime has decimated a generation of Russian civil society, democratic political opposition, and human rights organisations, including Memorial and the Moscow Helsinki Group; whereas the number of political prisoners in Russia, estimated to be at least 1 000, exceeds levels seen even during the late Soviet period, and there has been a significant increase in the number of individuals detained for criticising Putin’s policies, particularly concerning the war in Ukraine; whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Russia is holding at least 22 journalists in prison; N.	whereas the EU has frequently expressed its unequivocal solidarity with all those dissidents and the Russian people, who, despite the threat to their freedom and their lives and the pressure from the Kremlin and the Russian authorities, continue to fight for freedom, human rights and democracy; whereas the EU hosts a variety of Russian dissidents and representatives of the media and civil society who were forced to leave Russia as their criticism of the government put them at significant risk of retaliation from the authorities; O.	whereas the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Russian Federation has concluded that there is no longer any safe space for civic action or political opposition within Russia; P.	whereas the Venice Commission, in its Opinion No 992/2020, concluded that the speed of the preparation of the 2020 constitutional amendments was clearly inappropriate, that the hastily adopted 2020 amendments to the Constitution of Russia have disproportionately strengthened the position of the president and that the ad hominem exclusion from the term limits of the current and previous presidents contradicts the very logic of the adopted amendment limiting the president’s mandate to two terms; Q.	whereas, in its Resolutions 2519 (2023) and 2540 (2024), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe called on European governments to recognise Vladimir Putin as illegitimate after the end of his current presidential term and to cease all contact with him, except for humanitarian purposes and in the pursuit of peace; R.	whereas, in its 2021 recommendation on the direction of EU-Russia political relations, Parliament concluded that the constitutional changes implemented in June 2020 were illegal, as did the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in its Resolution 2519 (2023); S.	whereas the Russian Federation has been carrying out an illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine since 24 February 2022; whereas this war of aggression constitutes a blatant and flagrant violation of the UN Charter and of the fundamental principles of international law; T.	whereas on 17 March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin in view of his responsibility for the war crime of unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children during Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine;| Strongly Agree

94|The European Parliament Underlines that the refusal to allow independent international observation of the Russian presidential election, in accordance with Russia’s international commitments as an OSCE participating state, points to an unprecedented degree of democratic backsliding and a critical lack of willingness to honour international commitments and respect established principles of cooperation within international institutions; stresses that the decision of the Russian authorities not to invite the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission to observe the election shows that they want to deny voters an impartial and independent assessment of the election;| Strongly Agree
95|The European Parliament Urges the Member States of the European Union and the international community not to recognise the outcome of the Russian presidential election as legitimate, as it was held in the illegally occupied territories of Ukraine, and, even within Russia, was neither free nor fair, did not meet the basic international electoral standards, and thus lacked democratic legitimacy, and urges to limit relations with Putin to matters necessary for regional peace as well as humanitarian and human rights purposes, for example prisoner exchanges, the return of deported children to Ukraine or calling on the release of political prisoners;| Strongly Agree

102|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to work with international partners and organisations to provide support to political prisoners, in particular medical and legal assistance, which is being limited or denied to them, and to seek ways to secure their release; reiterates its call for the diplomatic representations of the EU and its Member States to continue to closely monitor court proceedings against members of the Russian political opposition and the conditions in which they are being held in prison; calls for the EU and its Member States to continue to raise awareness about the deteriorating human rights situation in Russia and to pressure the Russian Government to uphold its international obligations;| Agree
103|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to continue to actively support independent Russian civil society organisations, independent media outlets and human rights defenders; calls for the EU and its Member States to actively engage with and offer support to the Russian democratic opposition who oppose Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine;| Agree
104|The European Parliament Urges the Member States to provide humanitarian visas and other support to Russian dissidents, including lawyers, who are at risk of political persecution; reiterates its call for an EU-wide multi-entry visa scheme for human rights defenders and politically persecuted individuals and for the existing flexibility to be used to address gaps in legislation, as proposed by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in its 2023 report entitled ‘Protecting Human Rights Defenders at Risk: EU entry, stay and support’; stresses, in this regard, that such schemes may also extend to opposition leaders, civil society activists and otherwise politically persecuted persons;| Agree
105|The European Parliament Urges the EU institutions and the Member States to prepare for a situation in which Russia, like Belarus, ceases issuing passports in its consulates, in which case it may be necessary for the EU and all its Member States to recognise de facto statelessness and issue travel documents, as provided for in Article 28 of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons;| Agree
106|The European Parliament Calls for the simplification of processes for Russian dissidents in the EU to register organisations and entities, open bank accounts and carry out other administrative tasks in order to allow them to continue their work in exile;| Agree
107|The European Parliament Deplores the fact that the Prime Minister of Hungary, Viktor Orbán, chose to break ranks with the EU and congratulate Vladimir Putin on his sham re-election;| Strongly Agree
108|The European Parliament Expresses support for the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Russian Federation, Mariana Katzarova, and calls on the Member States to ensure that the UN Human Rights Council extends her mandate again in 2024;| Agree
109|The European Parliament Reiterates its unwavering solidarity with the people of Ukraine and its support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognised borders; reiterates, therefore, its strong condemnation of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and demands that Russia and its proxy forces terminate all military actions, cease attacks against residential areas and civilian infrastructure, withdraw all military forces from the entire internationally recognised territory of Ukraine, end forced deportations of Ukrainian civilians, release all detained Ukrainians, particularly children, and permanently cease violating or threatening the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine;| Strongly Agree
110|The European Parliament Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the Russian authorities TEXTS ADOPTED P9_TA(2023)0373 The despicable terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel, Israel’s right to defend itself in line with humanitarian and international law and the humanitarian situation in Gaza PE754.339 European Parliament resolution of 19 October 2023 on the despicable terrorist attacks by Hamas against Israel, Israel’s right to defend itself in line with humanitarian and international law and the humanitarian situation in Gaza (2023/2899(RSP)) The European Parliament, –	having regard to its previous resolutions on the Israel-Palestine conflict, –	having regard to the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly, –	having regard to the European Council statement of 15 October 2023 on the situation in the Middle East, –	having regard to Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter which ensure the right of self-defence, –	having regard to the joint statement by the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America of 9 October 2023, –	having regard to the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements of 13 September 1993 (the Oslo Accords), –	having regard to the EU terrorist list, which includes Hamas as a terrorist organisation, –	having regard to international humanitarian law, in particular the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols, –	having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure, A.	whereas on 7 October 2023, close to the 50th anniversary of the attack that started the Yom Kippur War, the terrorist group Hamas, which is listed on the EU list of terrorist organisations, carried out a despicable terrorist attack against Israel of unprecedented cruelty, including acts of torture and rape; whereas the Hamas terrorist fighters entered Israeli territory during a massive launch of more than 5 000 rockets; whereas these brutal attacks, which were directed mainly at civilians, resulted in the assassination of over 1 400 Israelis and at least 75 foreign nationals, including EU citizens, the majority of whom were civilians, including children and babies; whereas at least 3 400 people have been wounded; whereas the terrorist group Hamas kidnapped an estimated of 200 individuals and is now holding them hostage in Gaza, including children, women, elderly people, Holocaust survivors and some EU nationals; whereas on 13 October 2023, the terrorist group Hamas announced that 13 hostages had lost their lives; B.	whereas 7 October 2023 was the deadliest day for Jewish people since the Shoah and accounts for the highest number of fatalities in a single day in Israel’s history; C.	whereas the EU and its Member States have strongly condemned the crimes committed by Hamas and have repeatedly called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held in Gaza; whereas key regional players such as Iran, Qatar, Kuwait, Syria and Iraq have blamed the attack on Israel; whereas the risk of escalation in the region is the highest in many decades; D.	whereas on 9 October 2023, the Minister of Defense of Israel announced a full siege of the Gaza Strip, including cutting off the supply of electricity, food and water to the area; whereas the Israeli Government has called up 360 000 reservists; whereas on 13 October 2023, the Israeli Defense Forces called for the evacuation of around 1.1 million Palestinians living in Gaza City and in the north of the Gaza Strip to the south of the area; whereas the suspension of the supply of electricity, food, water and fuel to the Gaza Strip risks provoking the further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the region, as the population of Gaza is not able to leave, because its border with Egypt has been closed for more than a week; whereas over 2 600 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, more than 10 000 have been wounded and over one million Gazans, half the Gaza Strip’s population, have been displaced within the Strip so far; E.	whereas the terrorist organisation Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people and their legitimate aspirations; F.	whereas the Commission did not speak with one voice on this conflict, as contradictory statements were released by the Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement and the Commissioner for Crisis Management; whereas further statements were made by the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission President; G.	whereas 30 years after the Oslo Accords, the Israel-Palestinian conflict remains unresolved; H.	whereas a significant amount of false information and manipulated content has been circulating; whereas there should be no tolerance for terrorism, the glorification of violence or those calling for the destruction of Israel and Jewish life;| Strongly Agree
111|The European Parliament Condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the despicable terrorists attacks committed by the terrorist group Hamas against Israel and expresses its support for the State of Israel and its people; reiterates that the terrorist organisation Hamas needs to be eliminated;| Strongly Disagree
16|The European Parliament Urges the Hungarian Government to withdraw the decree cancelling state-funded shelter for refugees from western Ukraine and uphold its responsibilities under the EU Temporary Protection Directive;| Agree
17|The European Parliament Calls on the Council to maintain and extend its sanctions policy against Russia and Belarus and non-EU countries and entities providing the Russian military complex with military and dual-use technologies and equipment, while monitoring, reviewing and enhancing the policy’s effectiveness and impact; condemns Iran’s recent transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia; urges the Member States to further broaden and strengthen the sanctions regime against Iran and North Korea in view of these countries’ military support for Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and to add additional Chinese entities and individuals to the EU sanctions list for their support to Russia’s defence and security sector; underlines the need to prevent critical components produced in EU countries from reaching the Russian military industry and considers it is essential to strengthen controls on the export and maintenance of high-tech equipment produced in the EU, as well as to increase law enforcement measures and cooperation to prevent sanctions circumvention; calls on the Council to systematically tackle the circumvention of sanctions by EU-based companies, third parties and non-EU states; calls on the Council to design a new horizontal sanctions regime to counter this circumvention, which will require a more general and holistically applicable instrument to target circumvention in all regimes implemented by the EU; invites the Council and the Member States to address, in particular, the issue of Western-designed components being used in Russian weapons and military equipment;| Agree
18|The European Parliament Stresses that the impact of existing sanctions and of financial and military support to Ukraine will continue to be undermined as long as the EU allows Russian fossil fuels to be imported; calls for a ban on importing Russian grain, potash and fertilisers, as well as raw materials, including aluminium, steel products, uranium, titanium, nickel, wood and wood products, and gas and oil; calls for the EU and the Member States to introduce a full ban on re-exported Russian refined oil products; calls, furthermore, for the implementation of ‘rules of origin’ documentation, which would ensure the true origin of oil products imported to the EU;| Strongly Disagree
19|The European Parliament Calls on the G7 countries to more effectively enforce the price cap imposed on Russian seaborne oil and to crack down on the loopholes used by Russia to repackage and sell its oil at market prices; calls for the EU and its Member States to exercise strict control over Russia’s ‘shadow fleet’, which, in addition to violating EU and G7 sanctions, poses an immense ecological threat to the ecosystem as a result of its technical deficiencies and frequent breakdowns;| Strongly Agree
20|The European Parliament Calls for a full embargo of Russian liquefied natural gas and sanctions against Gazprom and Russian oil companies; calls for the EU to impose the requirement that Arc-7 ice-class vessels exporting Russian liquefied natural gas be included on the sanctions lists of the US Office of Foreign Assets Control and of the EU, denying them access to ports or Western maritime services; calls for the EU and its Member States to impose targeted sanctions on maritime vessels used by Russia to circumvent sanctions on its oil and gas exports and servicing of its energy projects in the Arctic;| Strongly Agree. The resolution's arguments for implementing these measures, such as holding Russia accountable for its aggression and sending a strong message to deter further actions, justify the conclusions drawn.
21|The European Parliament Calls for sanctions on Russia’s nuclear sector and targeted sanctions against perpetrators of violations of nuclear safety and security at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant;| Strongly Agree
22|The European Parliament Condemns the increasing number of hybrid attacks carried out by Russia against the EU, its Member States and candidate countries, aimed at weakening European support for Ukraine through information manipulation, sabotage, covert destabilisation attempts and corruption; calls for the EU and its Member States to work strategically and proactively so as to counter hybrid threats, strengthen EU strategic communication and prevent Russia’s interference in political, electoral and other democratic processes in the EU and its neighbourhood;| Agree
23|The European Parliament Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the President, Government and Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, the Russian Government and the other governments concerned, and the United Nations TEXTS ADOPTED P9_TA(2023)0397 Effectiveness of the EU sanctions on Russia PE754.363 European Parliament resolution of 9 November 2023 on the effectiveness of the EU sanctions on Russia (2023/2905(RSP)) The European Parliament, –	having regard to its previous resolutions on Russia and Ukraine, in particular since the escalation of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine in February 2022, –	having regard to the Charter of the United Nations, –	having regard to the 11 consecutive packages of sanctions against Russia adopted by the EU since February 2022, –	having regard to Council Decision (EU) 2022/2332 of 28 November 2022 on identifying the violation of Union restrictive measures as an area of crime that meets the criteria specified in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, –	having regard to the report of its Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs of 7 July 2023 on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the definition of criminal offences and penalties for the violation of Union restrictive measures, –	having regard to Rules 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure, A.	whereas since 24 February 2022, when Russia re-launched its unprovoked, unjustified and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, the geopolitical situation in Europe has fundamentally changed; whereas Russia’s forces have conducted indiscriminate attacks against residential areas and civilian infrastructure, killing thousands of Ukrainian civilians, forcibly deporting and illegally imprisoning Ukrainian citizens in Russia and Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine and carrying out acts of terror throughout the country; B.	whereas since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, the EU has imposed 11 sanctions packages against Russia aimed at weakening its economic base and thus curtailing its ability to wage war, including restrictive measures against almost 1 800 individuals and entities responsible for or involved in the war in Ukraine, bans on imports of numerous goods and services from Russia such as oil and raw materials, and a prohibition on exports to Russia of weapons, military equipment and dual-use goods; whereas the sanctions also include a prohibition on all transactions with the Central Bank of Russia, the exclusion of key Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system and the suspension of the transmission and distribution of certain Russian state-owned or state-backed disinformation outlets; C.	whereas, in addition, the Council has imposed restrictive measures under the EU’s Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime on several individuals responsible for serious human rights violations in the Russian Federation and in the territories of Ukraine that Russia has temporarily occupied; whereas the EU has also adopted additional sanctions against Belarus, in response to its involvement in the war of aggression against Ukraine, and Iran, in relation to the use of Iranian drones in Russia’s war; D.	whereas measuring the impact of sanctions presents numerous challenges, including the lack of reliable figures and statistics; whereas the impact of EU sanctions cannot be easily separated from the impact of US and other sanctions, the Russian counter-sanctions or the impact of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine; whereas most experts warn that, although the sanctions are working, their impact is not severe enough to limit Russia’s ability to wage war against Ukraine and call for additional measures to increase the scope and enforcement of the sanctions; whereas, although the EU sanctions against Russia are unprecedented, the impact on the Russian economy so far seems to be smaller than initially forecasted and there are worrying signs that the effectiveness of the sanctions is wearing off; whereas the sanctions against Russia have forced and are still forcing their targets into a permanent search for costly byways; E.	whereas EU Member States, together with the Price Cap Coalition, have introduced price caps on seaborne crude oil, petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals which originate in or are exported from Russia; whereas they set these price caps at USD 60 per barrel for crude oil, USD 45 per barrel for discounted petroleum products and USD 100 per barrel for premium petroleum products; whereas various studies estimate that production costs for Russian crude oil per barrel is approximately USD 15 and for diesel USD 20; whereas, therefore, the current price caps are still enabling significant profits for Putin’s regime; F.	whereas Russia’s oil and gas export revenues decreased by 38 % between January 2022 and January 2023; whereas Russia’s share of European gas demand fell from 45 % in 2021 to 23 % in 2022 and to below 10 % in January 2023; whereas, according to reports, the volume of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) production has increased to record levels; whereas, despite the EU sanctions on Russian coal, its production increased by 0,3 % compared to 2021, reaching a record level; whereas since the beginning of the war, Russia has earned EUR 532 billion in revenue from fossil fuel exports, of which the Member States’ purchases accounted for more than EUR 178 billion; whereas in 2022 alone, revenues from Russian energy resources amounted to USD 321 billion; G.	whereas since August 2023, it has been evident that Russia is finding new ways to circumvent the price cap on oil sanctions, and prices of Russian oil in the global markets have started to increase; whereas Russia has been able to redirect crude oil exports from Europe to alternative markets such as India, China and Türkiye; whereas EU imports from India and other nations of petroleum products made with Russian oil have soared, creating a backdoor route for Russian oil and undermining the impact of the EU sanctions; whereas EU-owned vessels transported the highest proportion of Russian crude oil in both 2022 and 2023; whereas in 2022, the share of revenues from exports of energy resources amounted to one third of the total income in the Russian Federation’s budget; whereas the sanctions on the export of Russian energy resources are having a strong impact on Russian state revenues; whereas, following the introduction of the price cap on oil in December 2022, Russia’s income from the export of energy resources has decreased significantly compared with pre-war levels; whereas Russia’s oil revenues rebounded in the first half of 2023, rising to the highest level since November 2022; H.	whereas purchases by EU Member States of Russian LNG or Russian-origin oil from non-EU countries are not restricted and are currently running well above levels seen before February 2022; whereas Russia is the EU’s second largest supplier of LNG, behind only the US; whereas the increase in LNG imports from Russia runs counter to the EU’s aim to end its reliance on Russian fossil fuels; whereas Russia is still making around EUR 690 million a day from its fossil fuel exports (data from August 2023); whereas the EU is still sending EUR 2 billion per month to Russia for fossil fuels; whereas, due to continued imports of pipeline gas and LNG, as well as various exceptions to the bans on importing crude oil and oil products, the EU still remains one of Russia’s largest clients for fossil fuels; I.	whereas, according to official Russian figures, the Russian economy allegedly shrank by only 2,1 % in 2022, much less than expected, despite its war of aggression against Ukraine and the international sanctions; whereas the International Monetary Fund forecasts, on the basis of the official Russian figures, that the Russian economy will grow by 2,2 % in 2023 and by 1,1 % in 2024; whereas Russia has announced that, in 2024, its defence budget will be increased by nearly 70 % and will reach EUR 107 billion, or 6 % of GDP (up from EUR 63 billion, or 3,9 % of GDP, in 2023); J.	whereas, nevertheless, on 1 November 2023 the Russian President called for officials to address the issue of high inflation, warning that the Russian economy faced increased pressure from Western sanctions; whereas inflation remains high in Russia, ticking upwards as the economy faces a weaker rouble and rising military spending on the offensive in Ukraine; K.	whereas EU imports from Russia have fallen since February 2022; whereas, despite the sanctions, in practice some Member States have increased trade with Russia since February 2022; L.	whereas a number of EU companies enjoy derogations under Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014 and, hence, continue to carry out business activities with Russian entities that are under financial and trade sanctions; whereas the competence of granting derogations belongs to the national authorities and the EU institutions are merely informed about the granted derogations, without the ability to contest them; whereas Parliament and other institutions do not have access to that essential information; whereas this derogation practice considerably reduces the desired impact of the EU sanctions, thus depriving one of the main EU foreign policy tools of its effectiveness and credibility; M.	whereas, in an attempt to counter the sanctions, Russia has turned to non-sanctioning countries in search of technology and other products; whereas the ever closer relations between Russia and China, both in terms of trade in energy and dual-use goods, as well as diplomatic and strategic support, have hampered the impact of the EU’s sanctions on Russia; whereas Russia’s trade with China hit record highs in 2022 and 2023; whereas China is now the source of around half of Russia’s imports, up from a quarter before the war; whereas Russia’s trade volume with India and Türkiye has also increased significantly; N.	whereas several analyses of captured Russian weaponry have shown that Russia continues to import critical Western components due to its ability to find alternative suppliers and routes, with imports of key items such as semiconductors even rising above pre-sanctions levels; whereas several non-sanctioning countries such as China, Türkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, some countries from the South Caucasus and Serbia have become hubs through which Russian entities reroute the products they import from the EU towards Russia or provide alternative routes for imports of dual-use goods and foreign-made technology and equipment; O.	whereas, in December 2022, the EU appointed David O’Sullivan as International Special Envoy for the Implementation of EU Sanctions; whereas a specific anti-circumvention tool was included in the latest sanctions package, adopted in June 2023; P.	whereas Rosatom and the Russian nuclear energy sector are still not included in the sanctions packages; whereas Rosatom, through its subsidiaries, has been providing critical imports of technologies and materials to the Russian military-industrial complex; whereas, over the course of 2022-2023, the Member States have made significant progress in reducing their dependence on the Russian nuclear industry; Q.	whereas, on 2 December 2022, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive on the definition of criminal offences and penalties for the violation of Union restrictive measures, with a view to facilitating the investigation, prosecution and punishment of violations of EU sanctions in all Member States; R.	whereas Russian civil society and opposition figures living in exile in the EU have struggled with the disproportionate impact of some of the sanctions on their daily lives in ways that do not correspond to the objective of the EU’s sanctions policy and instead harm the credibility of the EU;| Disagree.
24|The European Parliament Reiterates its condemnation in the strongest terms of Russia’s unprovoked, illegal and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and of the involvement of the Lukashenka regime in Belarus; reiterates its call on Russia to immediately terminate all military activities in Ukraine and to unconditionally withdraw all forces and military equipment from the entire internationally recognised territory of Ukraine, to end its forced deportations of Ukrainian civilians and to release all detained and deported Ukrainians, particularly children;| Strongly Agree
25|The European Parliament Underlines that the objective of EU sanctions in response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is to strategically weaken the Russian economic and industrial base, in particular the military-industrial complex, in order to undermine the ability of the Russian Federation to continue waging the war, attacking the civilian population and violating the territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to hamper Russia’s access to military technologies and components and to target Russian political and economic elites to undermine their support for the regime;| Agree.
26|The European Parliament Recalls that the effectiveness of international sanctions depends on the firmness, cohesion, cooperation, honesty and respect for the commitments of the states that have adopted them; calls for the Member States to clearly identify sanctioned Russian foreign assets being held in their jurisdictions and to ensure that they are effectively removed from the reach of Russian entities; highlights the need for a more harmonised approach and greater transparency on the reporting of the location and the amount of the assets frozen;| Agree
27|The European Parliament Underlines that, given that the EU sanctions on Russia are a foreign policy instrument aimed at ending an illegal war, circumventing such export restrictions on war-critical goods in certain grave cases could be considered and prosecuted as complicity in Russia’s war crimes;| Strongly Agree
28|The European Parliament Calls for the EU and its Member States to reinforce and centralise, at EU level, the oversight of sanctions implementation and to develop a sanctions circumvention prevention and monitoring mechanism to limit Russia’s ability to circumvent sanctions; calls on the Member States’ authorities to cooperate more closely on investigations of sanctions violations and circumvention and to demonstrate the consequences of such violations by dynamically and vigorously preventing and/or prosecuting violations of EU sanctions; calls, in this regard, for the EU institutions to reach a swift agreement on an ambitious directive on the definition of criminal offences and penalties for the violation of Union restrictive measures; underlines that penalties should remain proportionate but also sufficiently high to have a deterrent effect; calls on the European Council to adopt a decision expanding the powers of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office to include the crime of violation of Union restrictive measures, which would allow for greater harmonisation and consistent and uniform prosecution of such crimes throughout the EU;| Agree
29|The European Parliament Expresses deep concern regarding ongoing trade in sanctioned war-critical goods between Member States and Russia; deplores the serious lack of compliance culture regarding the EU sanctions on Russia; condemns the practice in which sanctioned goods from the EU are sold to companies or individuals from non-EU countries and then shipped directly from the EU to Russia; calls for the EU and its Member States to set up systems through which information on transactions can be shared more effectively in order to improve the enforcement of sanctions related to military and dual-use goods; calls on the Member States’ authorities to provide the necessary information and assistance to companies in order to improve compliance with EU sanctions and to engage with the companies whose products are being exported to Russia in order to minimise the risk of unknowingly violating export controls; calls on the Member States to thoroughly investigate the compliance of companies with export restrictions on listed goods and to impose dissuasive penalties;| Agree
30|The European Parliament Calls on the Member States to expand export controls to cover more categories of goods, to align export controls across jurisdictions and to enforce measures consistently to close loopholes; calls for the EU and its Member States to take particular measures to prevent advanced technology products that are being exported to non-EU countries from ending up in Russia, and to constantly monitor developments so as to identify how sanction circumvention schemes work and to adapt the sanctions regimes accordingly;| Agree
31|The European Parliament Urges companies from EU and EU candidate and potential candidate countries to withdraw their operations from Russia and to exercise particular diligence when exporting goods that are prohibited from export to Russia; emphasises that EU companies and their subsidiaries that are found to be in violation of EU restrictive measures should be ineligible for funding, including for tenders and other forms of funding as part of the Ukraine Facility and other reconstruction programmes in Ukraine; considers that the companies using derogations from the application of the EU sanctions against Russia, and, as such, maintaining business activities with Russia, should not benefit from any EU funds, technical assistance or participation in EU-funded projects; considers that these companies should be automatically put on the Early Detection and Exclusion System and that their status on the Arachne risk scoring tool should be updated accordingly; believes that the same principle should apply, mutatis mutandis, to public procurement, whereby government departments or local authorities should not be allowed to purchase work, goods or services from companies derogating from EU sanctions under Council Regulation (EU) No 269/2014;| Strongly Agree
