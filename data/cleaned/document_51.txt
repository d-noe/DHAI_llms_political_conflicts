The European Parliament,
– having regard to its previous resolutions on Ukraine,
– having regard to the Association Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part, and to the accompanying Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area between the EU and Ukraine, signed in 2014 (AA/DCFTA),
– having regard to the application for EU membership by Ukraine on 28 February 2022, the Commission communication of 17 June 2022 entitled ‘Commission Opinion on Ukraine’s application for membership of the European Union’ (COM(2022)0407) and the subsequent European Council conclusions of 23 and 24 June 2022,
– having regard to the UN Charter, the Hague Conventions, the Geneva Conventions and the additional protocols thereto, and to the Rome Statute,
– having regard to the joint statement following the 23rd EU-Ukraine Summit of 12 October 2021,
– having regard to the European Council conclusions of 15 December 2022,
– having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,
A. whereas the Russian Federation has been carrying out an illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine since 24 February 2022; whereas this war of aggression constitutes a blatant and flagrant violation of the UN Charter and of the fundamental principles of international law; whereas the geopolitical situation in Europe has fundamentally changed, which necessitates bold, brave and comprehensive political, security and financial decisions by the EU; whereas Ukraine has suffered from Russian aggressions ever since protests broke out in November 2013 against the decision by the then President to suspend the signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement;
B. whereas Russia’s forces have conducted indiscriminate attacks against residential areas and civilian infrastructure; whereas thousands of civilians, including hundreds of children, have already been murdered and many more have been tortured, harassed, sexually assaulted, kidnapped or forcibly displaced; whereas this inhumane conduct by the Russian forces and their proxies is in total disregard of international humanitarian law; whereas on 30 September 2022, Russia unilaterally declared its annexation of the partly Russian-occupied Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, in addition to its previous annexation of the Crimean peninsula;
C. whereas Ukraine’s political leadership and its people have shown remarkable determination to maintain the functioning of state institutions and public services despite the war;
D. whereas the 24th EU-Ukraine Summit is due to take place on 3 February 2023 in Kyiv; whereas this summit provides a prime opportunity not only to discuss the situation on the ground and Ukraine’s current priorities, including financial and military support, accountability for Russian war crimes, crimes against humanity and crime of aggression, global outreach, restrictive measures and food and energy security, but also to take action needed for Ukraine to continue its reform effort, as stipulated in the AA/DCFTA and the seven priorities indicated in the Commission opinion of 17 June 2022 and those leading towards EU membership;
E. whereas the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement in force since 2014 has already led to a substantial intensification of political dialogue and to the strengthening of political association and economic integration, and has opened up new prospects for sectoral cooperation;
F. whereas the Council, in its conclusions of 13 December 2022 on enlargement and stabilisation and association process, invited the Commission to prepare a roadmap outlining the next steps to ease Ukraine’s access to the EU single market, using the full potential of the AA/DCFTA with Ukraine;
G. whereas on 17 June 2022 the Commission published its opinion on Ukraine’s application for EU membership and recommended granting EU candidate status to Ukraine on the understanding that certain reform measures such as on the rule of law and the fight against corruption be taken; whereas the Council, in its conclusions of 13 December 2022, recalled that the Commission had been invited to report on the fulfilment of the conditions specified in the Commission’s opinion of 17 June 2022 as part of its regular enlargement package in 2023, and took note of the Commission’s intention to provide an update in spring 2023 instead;
H. whereas there is no ‘fast-track’ for EU membership, and accession remains a complex, merit-based and structured process and requires effective implementation of reforms and the transposition of the acquis; whereas each country’s progress on the path to accession is assessed on its own merit and that of its reform process; whereas however, that does not exclude a fast start to the process as a manifestation of the EU’s commitment to Ukraine in the new geopolitical context created by the Russian aggression; whereas the EU’s capacity to absorb new members will play an important role in future accessions;
I. whereas decentralisation and strong local self-government have become a cornerstone of Ukraine’s democracy and are an important factor in Ukraine’s resilience during the war; whereas having municipalities lead on local reconstruction is critical to ensuring that national and international funds for reconstruction flow to where they are most needed;
1. Reiterates its condemnation, in the strongest possible terms, of the Russian Federation’s war of aggression against Ukraine, as well as the involvement of Belarus in this war, and demands that Russia immediately terminate all military activities in Ukraine and unconditionally withdraw all forces and military equipment from the entire internationally recognised territory of Ukraine;

9. Supports the establishment of the military assistance mission to train the Ukrainian armed forces on EU soil; recognises the current work of the EU Advisory Mission for Civilian Security Sector Reform in Ukraine and welcomes the recent adjustment of its mandate in order to support Ukrainian authorities in facilitating the investigation and prosecution of any international crimes committed by the Russian armed forces and mercenaries in the context of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine;

13. Welcomes the European Council’s decision to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine; underlines that accession to the EU must take place in accordance with Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union, based on respect for the relevant procedures and conditional upon the fulfilment of the established criteria, in particular the so-called Copenhagen criteria for EU membership, and remains a merit-based process that requires adoption and implementation of relevant reforms, in particular in the areas of democracy, the rule of law, human rights, fundamental freedoms, a market economy and implementation of the EU acquis;
14. Reaffirms its commitment to Ukraine’s membership of the European Union; believes that it represents a geo-strategic investment in a united and strong Europe; reiterates that Ukraine’s application for EU membership equates to showing leadership, resolve and vision in today’s context of the brutal Russian war of aggression and sends a clear political message that Ukraine has irreversibly chosen a European path, which will be supported by its European partners;
