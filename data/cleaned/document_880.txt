The killing of Tamaz Ginturi, a Georgian citizen, by Russia’s occupying forces in Georgia
European Parliament resolution of 23 November 2023 on the Georgian citizens Tamaz Ginturi killed and Levan Dotiashvili abducted by the Russian occupation forces in the occupied Tskhinvali region of Georgia (2023/2981(RSP))
The European Parliament,
– having regard to its previous resolutions on Russia and Georgia,
– having regard to Rule 144(5) and 132(4) of its Rules of Procedure,
A. whereas on 6 November 2023, on the eve of the Commission’s presentation of the enlargement package, Russian occupying forces killed Georgian citizen Tamaz Ginturi, and abducted and then released Levan Dotiashvili, following international pressure; whereas this happened in the village of Kirbali near the Administrative Boundary Line (ABL);
B. whereas the killing is another instance of Russia’s illegal arrests and kidnappings in Georgia’s occupied regions and represents Russia’s blatant disregard for international law and human life, including by committing ethnic discrimination, installing barbed wire fences, erecting barriers, conducting illegal military exercises and closing the ABL’s ‘crossing points’, all of which cause suffering and increase the risk of escalation;
C. whereas Russia continues its illegal occupation of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia in violation of Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the EU-mediated ceasefire agreement of 12 August 2008; whereas Russia completely isolates the occupied regions from the rest of Georgia and the international community, making it impossible for UN missions and the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM) to carry out their mandates fully;
D. whereas the Russian occupiers exercise impunity for the brutal murder of internally displaced Georgian citizens, including Archil Tatunashvili, Giga Otkhozoria and Davit Basharuli, and for the death of Irakli Kvaratskhelia; whereas others, like Irakli Beuba remain imprisoned; whereas in 2018, the Georgian Government adopted the ‘Otkhozoria-Tatunashvili List’ of individuals accused and convicted of violating human rights in the occupied regions;
1. Strongly condemns the murder of Tamaz Ginturi and the illegal abduction of Levan Dotiashvili; extends its condolences to the families of all murdered Georgian citizens; calls for a thorough investigation into this and other murders; demands that those responsible be held accountable and brought to justice;
2. Reiterates its steadfast support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders; strongly condemns Russia’s illegal occupation of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia and the continued illegal ‘borderisation’ and ‘passportisation’ activities in those regions; urges Russia to fully implement the EU-mediated ceasefire agreement of 12 August 2008 and unconditionally withdraw all occupational forces; calls for adequate funding and improved capabilities for the EUMM;
3. Demands the release of all Georgian citizens in the illegal custody of the occupation regime; calls on the Council to create an EU sanctions list, taking into account the Otkhozoria-Tatunashvili List, and to impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for violations of Georgian sovereignty, territorial integrity and human rights;
4. Denounces Russian violations of Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and interference in Georgian domestic politics; underlines that this must not influence Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic integration;
5. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Member States, the Council of Europe, the United Nations Human Rights Council, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the President, Government and Parliament of Georgia and the Russian authorities.
