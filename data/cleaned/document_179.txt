ANNEX TO THE LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION
Joint statement by the European Parliament and the Council on the appropriate budgetary nomenclature for the Ukraine Facility
Without prejudice to the prerogatives of the budgetary authority in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure and to the Commission’s powers to establish the draft budget, the European Parliament and the Council invite the Commission to propose the creation of at least one budget line for Pillar I of the Ukraine Facility, two budget lines under Pillar II, including for the provisioning of the Common Provisioning Fund for the Ukraine Guarantee established under Chapter IV of the Ukraine Facility Regulation, three budget lines under Pillar III for the Union accession assistance and other measures, the borrowing costs subsidies and the provisioning of the Common Provisioning Fund – Legacy, and a specific budget line for technical and administrative assistance expenditure for the implementation of the Facility 
Joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission relating to the exceptional nature of the Ukraine Facility
The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission share the view that the Ukraine Facility is an exceptional medium-term instrument of high geopolitical importance adapted to the uncertainty and unprecedented challenges of supporting a country at war with direct implications for the security of the Union. As a result, the Ukraine Facility provides a balance between flexibility and programmability of the Union´s response to address Ukraine´s financing gap, recovery, reconstruction and modernisation needs, while supporting Ukraine´s reform effort as part of its accession path to the Union. The objectives, financing and governance arrangements agreed for the Ukraine Facility respond to the exceptional and specific context and challenges in relation to which this particular Facility has been adopted. 
This solution for Ukraine should not therefore be considered as a precedent for future instruments of economic assistance to third countries.
