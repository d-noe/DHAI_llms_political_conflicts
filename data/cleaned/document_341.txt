– having regard to the European Council statement of 15 October 2023 on the situation in the Middle East,
– having regard to Articles 2(4) and 51 of the UN Charter which ensure the right of self-defence,
– having regard to the joint statement by the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America of 9 October 2023,
– having regard to the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements of 13 September 1993 (the Oslo Accords),
– having regard to the EU terrorist list, which includes Hamas as a terrorist organisation,
– having regard to international humanitarian law, in particular the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols,
– having regard to Rule 132(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,
A. whereas on 7 October 2023, close to the 50th anniversary of the attack that started the Yom Kippur War, the terrorist group Hamas, which is listed on the EU list of terrorist organisations, carried out a despicable terrorist attack against Israel of unprecedented cruelty, including acts of torture and rape; whereas the Hamas terrorist fighters entered Israeli territory during a massive launch of more than 5 000 rockets; whereas these brutal attacks, which were directed mainly at civilians, resulted in the assassination of over 1 400 Israelis and at least 75 foreign nationals, including EU citizens, the majority of whom were civilians, including children and babies; whereas at least 3 400 people have been wounded; whereas the terrorist group Hamas kidnapped an estimated of 200 individuals and is now holding them hostage in Gaza, including children, women, elderly people, Holocaust survivors and some EU nationals; whereas on 13 October 2023, the terrorist group Hamas announced that 13 hostages had lost their lives;
B. whereas 7 October 2023 was the deadliest day for Jewish people since the Shoah and accounts for the highest number of fatalities in a single day in Israel’s history;
C. whereas the EU and its Member States have strongly condemned the crimes committed by Hamas and have repeatedly called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held in Gaza; whereas key regional players such as Iran, Qatar, Kuwait, Syria and Iraq have blamed the attack on Israel; whereas the risk of escalation in the region is the highest in many decades;
D. whereas on 9 October 2023, the Minister of Defense of Israel announced a full siege of the Gaza Strip, including cutting off the supply of electricity, food and water to the area; whereas the Israeli Government has called up 360 000 reservists; whereas on 13 October 2023, the Israeli Defense Forces called for the evacuation of around 1.1 million Palestinians living in Gaza City and in the north of the Gaza Strip to the south of the area; whereas the suspension of the supply of electricity, food, water and fuel to the Gaza Strip risks provoking the further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the region, as the population of Gaza is not able to leave, because its border with Egypt has been closed for more than a week; whereas over 2 600 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, more than 10 000 have been wounded and over one million Gazans, half the Gaza Strip’s population, have been displaced within the Strip so far;
E. whereas the terrorist organisation Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people and their legitimate aspirations;
F. whereas the Commission did not speak with one voice on this conflict, as contradictory statements were released by the Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement and the Commissioner for Crisis Management; whereas further statements were made by the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission President;
G. whereas 30 years after the Oslo Accords, the Israel-Palestinian conflict remains unresolved;
